# Pocket Notes Application

## Project Overview
   Pocket Notes is a web application built with React and CSS modules for styling on the frontend, and Node.js with JSON Server on the backend. This application allows users to create groups, add notes to those groups, and view notes based on the selected group. It also provides a responsive user interface to ensure a seamless experience on various devices.

The project consists of two parts:
1.# Frontend: The React-based web application responsible for the user interface, group management, note creation, and note display.
2.# Backend: The Node.js backend powered by JSON Server, which stores and serves the notes and group data.
